# Cloudy

Cloudy is a weather forecast app to test  skills, that I learned in java and android studio.

App is capable of forecasting weather and weather conditions in current moment of time, forecast for next 24 hours with 3 hours gap,
also will provide weather condtitons and average values if minimum and maximum temperatures for next five days,including current day.

I add a few cities to the main_acitvity for testing, but you can also use search by city name.

In my mind i have some uprgdades wich i will do in later builds:
1.Implement larger cities list, maybe list will be based on current location of the user.
2.Make weather icons and conditions more accurate, now list only includes crucial weather conditions.
3.Use some other values instead of average values in 5 day forecast, but right now i dont see any free api on openweathermap to provide more corresponding data.
